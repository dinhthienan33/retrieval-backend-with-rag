We'll talk about major projects you've led, how you think through problems, and how you drive work forward. You won't need to prepare anything in advance..3. Get to know the leadership team.Since we're a small, growing tight-knit team, this role will also work closely and regularly with everyone within BluByrd, so we feel itâs important that you get a chance to meet our Founder, Dr Timothy Davis, and VP of Operations, Stephanie Jones.4. Reference conversations.We will talk to a few people you've worked with. By this point, we're excited to work with you and are mainly focused on learning how to effectively work with you and set you up for success..Why âBluByrdâ?.A âBluebird Dayâ is a skiing term, used to describe a period of time characterized by sunny, cloudless weather, typically after a night of snowfall..Existing manual processes are tedious and frustrating for those on the ground coordinating critical patient surgeriesâschedulers, MAs, and back office staff.
